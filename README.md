## 📊 Methodology

### Data Collection

**Sources Analyzed**: 4,351 total locations
- **7 Bank ATM Networks**: 2,475 ATMs across Azerbaijan
- **3 Retail Chains**: 1,875 high-traffic locations
- **Data Validation**: Coordinates verified, duplicates removed

### Analysis Techniques

1. **Geographic Clustering**
   - Haversine formula for precise distance calculations
   - 2km radius = standard ATM service area
   - Vectorized NumPy operations for performance

2. **Coverage Gap Detection**
   - Identify competitor ATMs >2km from any BOB ATM
   - Calculate competitor density within 1km radius
   - Rank by strategic value

3. **ROI Scoring Algorithm**
   ```
   ROI Score = (Coverage Gap × 0.30) + (Market Demand × 0.40) + (Retail Proximity × 0.30)

   Where:
   - Coverage Gap = min(distance_to_bob / 10, 1.0) × 30
   - Market Demand = min(competitor_density / 10, 1.0) × 40
   - Retail Proximity = max(0, (2.0 - retail_distance) / 2.0) × 30
   ```

4. **Competitive Intelligence**
   - Market share calculation by ATM count
   - Co-location analysis (500m threshold)
   - Network efficiency scoring (ATMs per km²)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Vectorized operations**: 10-100x faster than pandas loops
- **Caching**: `@st.cache_data` decorators for expensive calculations
- **Smart sampling**: Limit map visualizations to 500 points per layer
- **Haversine vectorization**: Process 1M+ distance calculations in <1 second

---

## 📈 Key Algorithms Explained

### 1. Coverage Gap Detection
```python
for each competitor_atm:
    distance = haversine(competitor_atm, nearest_bob_atm)
    if distance > 2km:
        competitor_density = count_nearby_competitors(1km radius)
        mark_as_high_priority_gap(distance, competitor_density)
```

### 2. Retail Opportunity Scoring
```python
for each retail_location:
    distance_to_bob = haversine(retail, nearest_bob_atm)
    competitor_count = count_competitors_within(0.5km)

    opportunity_score = (distance_to_bob / 10) × 50 + (competitor_count / 10) × 50

    if opportunity_score > 40: mark_as_excellent()
    elif 30 ≤ opportunity_score ≤ 40: mark_as_good()
    else: mark_as_fair()
```

### 3. Co-location Matrix
```python
for bank1 in competitors:
    for bank2 in competitors:
